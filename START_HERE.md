## 💡 Key Points to Emphasize

### Object-Oriented Programming:
✅ **Encapsulation** - Services hide complexity  
✅ **Abstraction** - Controllers work with high-level methods  
✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one job  
✅ **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling, easy to test  
✅ **Inheritance** - Controllers extend standard patterns

### Design Patterns:
✅ **MVC** - Model (Notebook), View (FXML), Controller (Dashboard, etc.)  
✅ **Service** - Encapsulates business logic (3 main services)  
✅ **Factory** - Creates UI elements (message bubbles, notebook cards)  
✅ **Observer** - Real-time data updates (text listeners)  
✅ **Adapter** - JSON serialization (LocalDateTime adapter)

### Architecture:
✅ **5-Layer Design** - UI → Controller → Service → Model → API  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Each layer has specific responsibility  
✅ **Async Processing** - Non-blocking operations  
✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive exception handling  
✅ **Data Persistence** - JSON storage, restores state

---

## ❓ Common Questions to Prepare For

**Architecture Questions:**
- "Why this layered architecture?"
- "How does separation of concerns help?"
- "What design patterns did you use?"
- "How would you scale this?"

**Technical Questions:**
- "How does conversation history work?"
- "Why multipart/form-data for file upload?"
- "How do you ensure thread safety?"
- "What happens if the API fails?"

**Design Questions:**
- "Why Java + JavaFX instead of Python?"
- "Why separate backend?"
- "What would you improve?"
- "How do you handle errors?"

*All answers are in PRESENTATION_STRATEGY.md and QUICK_REFERENCE.md*
